CBZ Description

A CBZ file ( Comic book zip ) is an archive file containing a list of images designed for the sequential viewing of images
( c.f. : Wikipedia / Comic book archive ).

Unlike the EPUB format, CBZ doesn’t have any mandatory extra files with metadata concerning the artwork ( like the title, 
authors’ names, description, etc .. ), even if some metadata efforts have emerged some years ago ( c.f.: Metadata in CBZ ).
Note also that CBZ is a DRM-less format ( c.f.: What is a digital comic file ).

Usually a list of ‘*.jpg’ or ‘*.png’ files, CBZ files are formated to have the same root name, let’s call it for example
ComicBookImage_X.jpg, where X is the page number. Naturally, the range of numbers depends on the size of the artwork.
Zero padding is required for consistent ordering of pages:  let’s say we have 95 pages in our comic book, page numbers can
be represented as a range from 01 to 95, but the most common usage is a representation going from 001 to 095. These rules
are important to have a correct ordering without any table of content.
